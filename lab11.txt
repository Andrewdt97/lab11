    Compare and contrast your development and production deployments and explain how each is designed.
    	The production enviornment is optomized for performance while the development has nice features to make updating easier.
    	In the production enviornment, we are uglifying the JS and running other optimizations while the development deployment
    	had the nifty auto reload on modules.

    List the optimizations youâ€™ve configured for this production version and, if possible, find evidence of then in the deployed application files.
    	UglifyJS and OptomizeOccuranceOrderPlugin. The bundle.js is now much more compact (less white space), I don't see where OptomizeOccurranceOrderPlugin
    	has an effect, but it minimizes the id length for modules and chunks.
